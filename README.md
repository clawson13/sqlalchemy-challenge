# Surf's Up! Climate API

Homework for Boot Camp Week 10: SQLAlchemy; Submitted by Corey Lawson-Enos

## Summary
* SQLAlchemy code that studies Hawaiian weather station data minimums, maximums, and averages for period 2010-2017. 
* Calculates normals to predict temperature range for future dates as specified by the user. 
* Includes API feature.

## Technologies
SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy SciPy, Jupyter Notebook

## API Access

* Open app.py file from Terminal/Command Prompt: python app.py
* Copy running URL (screenshot below), paste to browser:

## Additional Analysis
* T-test comparing June/December mean temperatures does not show significant difference between the two months, suggesting year-round, temperate weather.

* Sample area plot generator used to predict normals for future periods:
