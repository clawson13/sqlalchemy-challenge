* Includes API feature 

## Technologies
SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy SciPy, Jupyter Notebook

## API Access

* Per the following bar chart, an analysis of average salary by job title casts doubt on the dataset's accuracy/reality. Senior Staff and regular Staff show higher average salaries than positions that likely require much more significant experience and education and, therefore, higher compensation: Managers, Engineers, Leaders, etc.
